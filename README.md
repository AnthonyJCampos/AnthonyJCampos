ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anthony Campos

Iâ€™m a Frontend Engineer / Web Developer with proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and also experienced in React and Wix.

Iâ€™m currently developing a Member Directory for a non-profit organization utilizing JavaScript.

I utilize my GitHub for displaying ongoing and current projects, as well as a place for me to explore new technologies. If you are interested in exploring some of the projects Iâ€™ve developed, please see the following repositories:

Major Projects:

- Washington Association for Marriage and Family Therapy Website Feature Updates: This is my current project, where I'm building a member directory for a non-profit organization. I've recently implemented a Form to collect member data points, which will be utilized in the directory for data. Additionally, I've developed a Member Profile page that displays these data points. You can find a video demonstration of the directory in development, and there is an accompanying readme that outlines the features and design choices on display in the video demo.

- Web Site for Camping Trip Coordination: As a front-end engineer with experience in Vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, I designed, developed, and deployed a custom web site for coordinating our camping trip. The site includes responsive design for seamless navigation across desktop and mobile devices. This project showcases my skills in front-end development and highlights my ability to build custom solutions from scratch.

- Windows 10 Calculator Clone: I challenged myself to remake the Microsoft Windows 10 Calculator app in HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. My goal was to not only recreate the original app but to also make it modular and expandable. I implemented advanced features, including the ability to handle a large set of combinations when it comes to user inputs, dynamically changing layout, integrating an API for real-time currency conversion rates, and managing states and data across the application. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in frontend development and my ability to handle complex user interaction scenarios.

- Holistic Sudoku Solver: The Holistic Sudoku Solver is a Java-based app that offers a unique approach to solving Sudoku puzzles. With a visually appealing user interface, the app uses a holistic backtracking algorithm that solves the most challenging parts of the puzzle before moving on to easier ones. To enhance user experience, the app also incorporates multithreaded techniques to slow down the solving process, allowing the user to watch as the puzzle is solved in real-time. With my strong software engineering skills, I was able to design and implement this project that showcases my ability to develop creative solutions to complex problems.

- Symbolic-Algebra-Calculator: This was a learning project utilizing C++ to increase my understanding of data structures and memory management. It implements stacks, trees, and a tokenizer to process input. You can find more information in the readme included in the folder.

- Game-Smoke-and-Fire: Is a game I developed in Java after my first course in programming. It had only been a few months, and I had no knowledge of UI design at the time, but was able to build a fully functional game that can support up 2-8 players locally with graphical effects. The game functionality is complete, and users can restart a game once finished or return to the main menu. Iâ€™d like to note my initiation was to make it multiplayer over a network, but I lacked the education on this topic at the time and never returned to the project.

Simple Projects

- JavaScript-Projects: This repo contains exploratory simple projects where I explore different features of the JavaScript language and how I can utilize them in frontend development. Current projects in the folder are: Guess Number Game, Bankist App, Bankist Marketing Page.
