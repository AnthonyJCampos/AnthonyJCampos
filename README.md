- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Anthony Campos
- Iâ€™m a Frontend Engineer / Web Developer with proficiency in Java, JavaScript, and Design. In addition, competent in C++. 
- Iâ€™m currently developing a Member Directory for a not profit organization utilizing JavaScript.   
- I utilize my GitHub for displaying ongoing and current projects as well as place for me to explore new technologies. If you are interested in exploring some of the projects, Iâ€™ve developed please see the following repositories:

- Wix-Website-Member-Directory: This is my current project, and you can find a video demonstration of the directory in development. There is an accompanying readme that will outline the features and design choices on display in the video demo. 

- JavaScript-Projects: This repo contains exploratory projects where explore different features of the JavaScript language and how I can utilize them in Frontend development. Current projects in the folder are: Guess Number Game, Bankist App,  Bankist Marketing Page.

- Java-Projects: Here you can find a Sudoku Solver with a complete GUI that utilizing a holistic back tracking technique to solve Sudoku puzzles. The process has been slowed down so that a user can visual/witness the steps the algorithm takes to solve a provided puzzle. If youâ€™d like to test the app please check out the Sample Puzzles.txt containing verified puzzles in String format. There is also a video demo. 

- Symbolic-Algebra-Calculator: This was a learning project utilizing C++ to increase my understanding of data structures and memory management. It implements stacks, trees, and a tokenizer to process input. You can find more information in the readme included in the folder. 

- Game-Smoke-and-Fire: Is a game I developed in Java after my first course in programming. It had only been a few months and I had no knowledge of UI design at the time but was able to build a fully functional game that can support up 2-8 players locally with graphical effects.  The game functionality is complete, and users can restart a game once finished or return to the main menu. Iâ€™d like to not my initiation was to make it multi player over a network, but I lacked the education on this topic at the time and never returned to the project.
